# RESTful API for a Bookstore

This project is a part of my study at Alura's course on building a RESTful API with Express and MongoDB. The API is designed to manage data related to a bookstore, including books, authors, and publishers. It provides a real-world example of how to represent and manipulate data in a RESTful manner.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete books, authors, and publishers.
- Fetch details about individual books, authors, and publishers.
- Comprehensive data management for a bookstore.
- Built with Express.js for routing and MongoDB for data storage.
